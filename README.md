##Virtual Playbill v2

#### Intro
This software is helping me win the battle against accumulated paper. My partner and I love seeing theater, and we needed a method for keeping track of our outings without keeping the playbill. I created the first version of virtualplaybill using meteor, and am now converting the application into node and angular. The use case of the application is currently restricted to a single collection, but I am open to suggestions about different models that would give it broader appeal.

#### Setup
```
$ git clone git@github.com:keighty/virtualplaybill2.git
$ cd virtualplaybill2/
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```
navigate to [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030/) to sign in.

#### Deploy location
This app is currently deployed at [virtual-playbill](https://virtual-playbill.herokuapp.com/) on heroku.
