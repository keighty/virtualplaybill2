##Virtual Playbill v2

I created the first version of virtualplaybill using meteor, and am now converting the application into node and angular. The use cases of the application is currently restricted to a single user, but I am open to suggestions about different models that would give it broader appeal. There is one shared data store, and I would like for users to share shows and their thoughts while maintaining their own collection.
